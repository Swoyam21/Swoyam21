## 🧠 About Me

I’m a senior Computer Information Technology student passionate about cybersecurity, network defense, and cloud security. I'm **CompTIA Security+ certified** and currently working as a **Cybersecurity Analyst Intern**, where I monitor security events using tools like **Splunk** and **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**.

I have hands-on experience with **Active Directory, Windows Server, Azure**, and hybrid identity management. I enjoy building and testing security labs that simulate real-world threats — from **vulnerability scans with Nessus** to **SIEM setups in Azure Sentinel**.

My projects focus on Blue Team operations, incident response, and scripting automation using **PowerShell and Python**.
